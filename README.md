`fiddleR` is an R package wrapper that enables those familiar with R to utilize the FIDDLE library developed in python.
The base code for this library can be found in the github repo [https://github.com/MLD3/FIDDLE](https://github.com/MLD3/FIDDLE).

Some functionality has been added to the python package contained in here, namely more methods for missing data imputation.

Please see the vignette `run_fiddle` for a detailed example of how to use this package.
